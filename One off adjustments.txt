One off adjustments

This is a set of adjustments we will need to run when initializing (or recreating the db).  

Visa's class A common stock should be associated with its ticker.  Not clear from the way its form 4s are filled out, but this can be confirmed with its 10k
Run the below snippet after the bulkupdate.py script has finished.  Then consider running nightlyupdate.py to make sure any additional connections are made.
from sdapp.models import SecurityPriceHist, Security
a = SecurityPriceHist.objects.filter(ticker_sym='V')[0]
classa = Security.objects.filter(issuer=a.issuer).filter(deriv_or_nonderiv='N').filter(short_sec_title='class a common stock')[0]
classa.ticker = 'V'
classa.save()
a.security = classa
a.save()
